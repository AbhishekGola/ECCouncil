# How to Get Domain and Subdomain Information Using Netcraft

Netcraft provides tools and services to gather information about domains and their associated subdomains. This data is valuable for security professionals conducting passive reconnaissance. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Netcraft to obtain domain and subdomain information.

## Steps to Get Domain and Subdomain Information

### 1. **Accessing the Netcraft Site Report**

1. **Visit Netcraft’s Website**: Go to the [Netcraft website](https://www.netcraft.com/).

2. **Navigate to the Site Report**: In the main menu, look for the "Site Report" option. This tool provides detailed information about a specific domain.

3. **Enter the Domain**: Input the domain you are interested in (e.g., `example.com`) into the search bar and click the search icon.

### 2. **Reviewing Domain Information**

After searching for the domain, Netcraft will provide a comprehensive report. Key sections to review include:

- **Hosting History**: Details about the domain’s hosting history, including previous and current hosting providers.
- **DNS Information**: Information about the domain's DNS setup, including nameservers and related records.

### 3. **Identifying Subdomains**

1. **Subdomain Enumeration**: Netcraft's reports may list known subdomains associated with the main domain. These subdomains are often found in sections like "Site Overview" or "DNS Information."

2. **Cross-Referencing Data**: Use additional tools to cross-reference and expand the list of subdomains. Tools like Netcraft’s browser extension can reveal more subdomains by analyzing page content and links.

### 4. **Using Netcraft’s Browser Extension**

1. **Install the Extension**: Install the Netcraft browser extension available for popular browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

2. **Navigate to the Domain**: Visit the main website of the domain you are investigating.

3. **Activate the Extension**: Use the extension to gather detailed information about the site, including potential subdomains. The extension can provide insights directly within your browser as you navigate.

### 5. **Analyzing Historical Data**

1. **Historical Hosting Data**: Review the historical hosting data to understand changes in hosting providers and IP addresses. This can uncover old subdomains that might still be active.

2. **Certificate Information**: Analyze SSL/TLS certificates for the domain, which may list associated subdomains. Netcraft provides certificate details in its reports.

### 6. **Utilizing Netcraft’s Phishing Site Feed**

1. **Phishing Site Database**: Access Netcraft's phishing site database if you have an account. This can reveal subdomains used for phishing related to the target domain.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerts for new subdomains that appear in Netcraft’s phishing feed, indicating potential misuse or targeting.

## Conclusion

Netcraft is a powerful tool for gathering domain and subdomain information through its comprehensive reports and browser extensions. By leveraging Netcraft's capabilities, security professionals can enhance their passive reconnaissance efforts and gain valuable insights into their target's online infrastructure.
